Hi there.
This is going to be an amazing game one day, maybe.
It's all javascript, because that's the fashion these days.

To set up the server, install node.js, go to the silly-socket-game folder and run

  npm install
  
Then there's two scripts you can run:

  npm start
  npm test
  
You can probably guess what they do.


The server uses express.js and socket.io.
By default, the server will be on port 3000 unless you set the PORT environment variable.
